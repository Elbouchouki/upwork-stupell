TERMS AND CONDITIONS
Purchase Order Terms & Conditions
(U.S. Affiliates of The TJX Companies, Inc.)
1.The purchase order (the “Order”) includes the terms on the Order form, the terms set forth below, and 
all requirements contained in any Continuation to the Order, Supplement to the Order, Distribution and 
Routing Instructions to the Order, TJX’s Vendor Code of Conduct (provided at www.tjxlogistics.com), any 
Letter of Credit issued in connection with this Order (or other payment instrument, including wire transfer 
requirements), as well as all requirements provided at www.tjxlogistics.com. The Order (as defined 
above) constitutes the entire agreement between the purchaser named on the Order form (“Buyer”) and 
the vendor named on the Order form (“Seller”) with respect to the goods referenced on the same (the 
“Goods”) and any other subject matter of this Order. By acceptance of this Order, Seller agrees to comply 
with the Vendor Code of Conduct. Seller also agrees to comply with Buyer’s Statement of Policy 
Concerning Gifts, of which Seller acknowledges receipt. Where applicable, Seller further agrees to 
comply with Buyer’s Gemstone Quality Procedure, of which Seller acknowledges receipt. Seller agrees to 
require its employees to comply with Buyer’s policies and procedures.
2.This Order shall not be effective unless confirmed in writing by an authorized employee of Buyer. Any 
Goods “put in work” or shipped prior to receipt of such written confirmation are at Seller’s risk. Time is of 
the essence with respect to all dates and deadlines set forth in this Order. Seller shall be deemed to 
accept this Order upon the terms stated herein unless Seller shall give written notice of rejection within 
seven (7) days of the date of this Order. Upon its acceptance by Seller in accordance with the preceding 
sentence, this Order and the terms stated herein shall become a binding agreement between Buyer and 
Seller. If Seller shall accept this Order, but within said seven (7) days offers shipment dates other than 
those specified by Buyer in this Order or otherwise, Buyer may reject said proposed shipment dates, in 
whole or in part, by oral or written notice to Seller. To the extent (and only to the extent) said proposed 
shipment dates are not so rejected, Seller’s proposed shipment dates shall become a part of this Order; 
this Order shall be deemed amended so as to apply only to that portion of the Goods covered by those of 
Seller’s proposed shipment dates that are not rejected by Buyer; and as so amended, this Order shall 
become a binding agreement between Seller and Buyer. Except to the limited extent provided for in the 
preceding sentence, the Order is the only agreement between Seller and Buyer relating to the Goods; 
shall not be varied by any additional or inconsistent terms contained in any invoice, confirmation or other 
material of Seller; and may only be waived or changed by a written agreement signed by an officer of 
Buyer. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY LIMITATION TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED IN ANY PRIOR OR 
SUBSEQUENT OFFER MADE BY SELLER WITH RESPECT TO ANY OF THE GOODS, ANY 
ACCEPTANCE OF ANY SUCH OFFER CREATED BY THIS ORDER OR BY ANY PRIOR OR 
SUBSEQUENT CONDUCT OF BUYER (INCLUDING BUYER’S ACCEPTANCE OF OR PAYMENT FOR 
ANY OF THE GOODS) IS EXPRESSLY MADE CONDITIONAL ON SELLER’S ASSENT TO ANY AND 
ALL TERMS SET FORTH IN THIS ORDER THAT MAY BE DIFFERENT FROM OR ADDITIONAL TO 
THE TERMS OF SUCH OFFER. 
3.No receipt, rejection, acceptance, revocation of acceptance, resale, paymentor other action or 
omission by Buyer of or in respect of the Goods shall bar Buyer from at any time exercising any remedies 
Buyer may have as the result of failure of Seller, or the Goods, to comply with the terms of this Order. 
Buyer shall have no obligation to make payment hereunder prior to acceptance of the Goods. 
4.Receipt by Buyer of any Goods, irrespective of any contrary provisions contained in any document 
delivered or in any statement made by Seller to Buyer upon such receipt, shall not be deemed 
acceptance of said Goods. Such receipt shall evidence only the time and place thereof and the quantity of 
cartons and other shipping containers received. 
5.If any part or item of the Goods fails to conform to the requirements of this Order or any warranty 
provided herein, or is not shipped in compliance with Buyer’s shipping directions, the Goods may, at 
Buyer’s option, be rejected in whole or in part at any time after Buyer’s discovery of such failure or non-
compliance, regardless of whether said Goods or any other part or item of the Goods has been previously 
Page 5of 9
----------------Page (4) Break----------------
or may be thereafter received or accepted by Buyer. Upon such rejection, Buyer may, at its option and 
Seller’s risk and expense, either (a) return the Goods to Seller; (b) hold the Goods for Seller’s account; (c) 
sell the Goods for Seller’s account; or (d) dispose of the Goods. In the event of any such rejection, Buyer 
shall, in addition to any and all other rights and remedies provided by applicable law, be entitled to a 
credit from Seller for the amount paid (or that would otherwise have been payable) by Buyer for the 
Goods so rejected and for the amount of any damages owing to Buyer from Seller in respect of such 
rejected Goods. In the event Buyer is entitled to reject the Goods in whole or in part under the first 
sentence of this paragraph or otherwise, but Buyer nonetheless elects to accept some or all of the Goods, 
Buyer may, in Buyer’s sole discretion and without limitation on Buyer’s other rights and remedies in 
regard to any such accepted Goods or any other of the Goods, retain any accepted Goods for its own 
account, in which event Buyer shall, in addition to any and all other rights and remedies provided under 
this Order or by applicable law, be entitled to a credit from Seller for the amount paid (or that would 
otherwise have been payable) by Buyer for any of the Goods that Buyer may have elected to reject and 
for the amount of any damages owing to Buyer from Seller in respect of the accepted Goods or any of the 
Goods that Buyer may have rejected. Buyer’s rights to deal with rejected Goods exist notwithstanding that 
the Goods may be perishable or be of a type which may decline in value speedily.

material(s), workmanship, fit and appearance and will be properly marked and labeled as to weight, 
measure, material(s) and ingredients. Seller warrants that the Goods are new, merchantable and safe, 
free from defects in materials or workmanship, and that the handling, wearing or use (including, as 
applicable, ingestion) of the same will not cause harm to any person or damage to the property of any

manufactured (whether by Seller or not) and the manner in which they are sold, conveyed or shipped to 
Buyer shall comply with, all international and United States federal, state, and local laws, ordinances, 
rules, regulations, agency policy statements, and industry standards or best practices (referred to 
collectively as “laws and standards”) applicable to the Goods, or applicable to the advertising, design, 
distribution, labeling, marking, processing, pricing, production, promotion, sale or testing of the Goods, 
including, but expressly not limited to, laws and standards in the following areas: bribery, consumer 
protection, consumer product safety, hazardous substances, flammability, customs, discrimination, 
environment, employment, child labor, fair labor, forced labor, food, drug and cosmetic, foreign corrupt 
practices, occupational safety, product labeling and packaging, sexual or other unlawful harassment and

Improvement Act (15 U.S.C. § 2051 et seq.) as well as Buyer’s requirements and procedures related to 
the same.  Seller also warrants and agrees that all shipments to Buyer will comply with cargo security 
procedures which are in accordance with all applicable laws and standards and Buyer’s requirements 
provided at www.tjxlogistics.com. In addition, and without limiting the foregoing, Seller agrees at Buyer’s 
request to provide Buyer, before payment is required to be made, with test results and other records and 
documents of any kind sufficient to demonstrate compliance with all applicable laws and standards to 
Buyer’s satisfaction. Seller shall retain copies of all documents necessary to demonstrate compliance with 
any applicable laws and standards for a period of three (3) years from the date on which the Goods are 
delivered to Buyer, unless a longer period is specified by Buyer or the law. In addition, and without limiting 
the foregoing, if Seller is a U.S. person or entity and if relevant as indicated below, Seller represents that 
it has executed and filed with the appropriate federal agency continuing guarantees to demonstrate 
compliance with the following laws, if applicable, to the Goods covered by this Order: (1) the Flammable 
Fabrics Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1197 and 16 C.F.R. § 1608.3 (filing a continuing guarantee with the Consumer 
Product Safety Commission); (2) the Textile Fiber Products Identification Act and Rules, 15 U.S.C. § 70h 
and 16 C.F.R. §§ 303.36-38 (filing a continuing guarantee with the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”)); 
(3) the Wool Products Labeling Act of 1939 and Rules, 15 U.S.C. § 68g and 16 C.F.R. §§ 300.32-34 
(FTC); and/or (4) the Fur Products Labeling Act and Rules, 15 U.S.C. § 69h and 16 C.F.R. §§ 301.46-48 
(FTC). Seller represents that it has performed all tests and other measures that are required for the

each such signed guarantee and all such test results, before payment is required to be made. Seller 
Page 6of 9
----------------Page (5) Break----------------
further warrants that any and all clothing and textiles intended for use for clothing (other than children’s 
sleepwear, for which more stringent requirements apply) that are delivered to Buyer shall meet the 
requirements for “intermediate flammability, Class 1,” as set forth in regulations adopted pursuant to the 
Flammable Fabrics Act, and shall not be classified as either Class 2 or Class 3 (see 16 C.F.R. § 1610.3). 
Seller further warrants that the Goods have been tested to determine whether they have levels of 
chemicals that require a consumer warning under California’s Proposition 65 (Health & Safety Code § 
25249.5 et seq.) or any other law or standard, and that, unless Buyer was notified to the contrary by 
Seller in writing prior to the placement of this Order, none of the Goods require such a warning. Seller 
also warrants that the Goods do not have levels of such chemicals or other hazardous substances that 
would prohibit their sale under Proposition 65 or any other law or standard. Seller further agrees that, for 
any Goods found to contain a chemical at levels that require a warning under Proposition 65 or any other 
law or standard, prior to the placement of this Order Seller shall notify Buyer in writing that a warning is 
required for that product and provide Buyer with the appropriate product warning labels and/or signs. 
Seller also warrants that the Goods do not have levels of such chemicals that would prohibit or restrict 
their sale under any other law or standard, including California’s Lead-Containing Jewelry Law (Health 
and Safety Code §§ 25214.1-25214.4.2).  Seller warrants and represents that any gems which are a part 
of any goods ordered hereunder have been purchased from legitimate sources not involved in funding 
conflict and in compliance with United Nations resolutions.  Seller hereby guarantees that such gems, 
including without limitation, diamonds, are conflict free, based on personal knowledge and/or written 
guarantees provided by the supplier of these gems.
8.Seller warrants that the Goods and their markings, labels, design and appearance do not infringe any 
patents, trade dress, trademarks, tradenames, copyrights or other rights of others, nor unfairly compete 
therewith, and that the resale thereof by Buyer, to any person, in any place, with or without any such 
markings, labels, design or appearance, is not restricted in any manner whatsoever. Seller further 
warrants that all Goods bearing any name or trademark of any third party are genuine Goods 
manufactured with the authority, and in accordance with all applicable quality standards of such third 
party, and that all Goods are authorized for sale in the U.S. market. Seller agrees that all labels containing 
Buyer’s name or trademark will be removed from any Goods not received by Buyer. Seller further agrees 
that all excess labels over amounts required to fill Buyer’s orders will be either delivered to Buyer without 
charge or else destroyed, and in no way will said labels be sold or otherwise used. 
9.Nothing herein shall operate to exclude Seller’s warranties implied by law. No modification or exclusion 
of any warranty, express or implied, shall be effective unless agreed to by Buyer in a separate written 
instrument executed by Buyer solely for the purpose of such a modification or exclusion. No Seller’s 
warranty shall be excluded because of Buyer’s inspection of, or failure or refusal to inspect, the Goods. 
Seller agrees that any damage or loss resulting from any of the Goods not being as warranted by Seller 
will be deemed as having been proximately caused by Seller’s warranty breach regardless of whether, or 
when, Buyer or Buyer’s customers took action to inspect the Goods. Buyer shall have the right to audit 
and examine current or past compliance with any warranty by Seller in respect of the Goods. In that 
regard, Seller shall within five (5) business days of Buyer’s request, provide Buyer with documentation 
sufficient to establish Seller’s full compliance with any such warranty and shall otherwise cooperate (and 
ensure cooperation by any manufacturer or prior vendor of the Goods) as reasonably requested by Buyer 
with any such audit or examination. Seller agrees to immediately notify Buyer of any circumstance which 
does or may result in any of the Goods being in violation of any of Seller’s warranties in respect of the 
Goods. Seller agrees to provide Buyer (and to cause any manufacturer or prior vendor of the Goods to 
provide Buyer) any documents or information requested by Buyer related to production of the Goods, 
including without limitation documents or information sufficient to establish Seller’s compliance with any 
warranty that Seller may have made in respect of the Goods. 
10.In the event of any violation of any warranty or other obligation of Seller under this Order or otherwise 
with respect to any of the Goods, Buyer shall have the right to return any or all of the Goods to Seller for 
full credit and/or to be compensated for any and all loss or damages suffered by Buyer as a result of such 
violation, and/or such return, including but not limited to Buyer’s storage costs, freight costs and handling 
costs in respect of the Goods, Buyer’s incidental and consequential damages by reason of such violation 
and/or any such return (it being understood that Buyer’s consequential damages shall include without 
limitation Buyer’s lost profits on resale of the Goods and shall be calculated without regard to whether 
Page 7of 9
----------------Page (6) Break----------------
Buyer could have covered or did cover by acquiring substitute Goods), and all other costs and expenses 
associated with such violation or any such return. Seller agrees, at Buyer’s request, to assume the 
defense of any claim, action, subpoena, or demand brought or made against Buyer or any of its affiliates 
by any third party (a “third-party claim”) relating to this Order or arising out of or resulting directly or 
indirectly from any circumstance constituting (or which if proven would constitute) a failure or alleged 
failure of Seller or the Goods to conform to the terms of any obligation of Seller or any warranty made by 
Seller hereunder, and Seller shall be obliged to indemnify Buyer against all loss and expense, including 
counsel fees and costs of defending, incurred by Buyer as a result of any third-party claim that Buyer may 
request Seller to assume the defense of (it being understood that Buyer shall have the right to approve 
any settlement of such third-party claim). In the alternative, at Buyer’s option, and in Buyer’s sole 
discretion, Buyer may retain full control over the defense and settlement of any third-party claim and may 
require Seller to cooperate in such defense and settlement, all at Seller’s expense, including counsel 
fees, and in such event Seller shall indemnify Buyer against all loss and expense, including counsel fees 
and the costs of defending, resulting from such third-party claim. Seller’s indemnity hereunder shall be in 
favor of Buyer, and any company or organization (including any partnership and limited liability 
organization) controlling, controlled, by or under common control with Buyer (such companies or 
organizations sometimes referred to herein as “affiliates”), and each of the agents of Buyer and its 
affiliates. Seller agrees to maintain sufficient insurance for general liability coverage with an endorsement 
for products liability either naming Buyer as additional insured, or broad form vendorscoverage wherein 
Buyer becomes a certificate holder with respect to any Goods purchased hereunder, and such a 
certificate shall be provided, at Buyer’s request. Failure of Buyer to request or of Seller to provide a 
certificate of insurance shall not be construed to result in a waiver of any of Buyer’s rights or Seller’s 
obligations hereunder. Seller agrees to indemnify and hold Buyer and its affiliates and the agents of Buyer 
and its affiliates harmless from and against all claims or suits from third parties, including, without 
limitation, Buyer’s customers, and all loss and expense resulting therefrom, based upon or arising from or 
related to injuries to persons or damage to property caused, or alleged to be caused, by any defects in 
the Goods. 
11.If any rights of Seller hereunder shall be assigned (whether to a factor or otherwise) then, even after 
notice to Buyer of such assignment, the assignee shall be bound by, and subject to, any defenses which 
Buyer may have against Seller and any agreements made by Buyer and Seller regarding the Goods or 
payment therefor, whether such defenses and agreements come into existence before or after such 
assignment (including, without limitation, any claims for defects or returns, any allowances or credits, and 
any offsets that Buyer may have against the original Seller). Notwithstanding any such assignment, Seller 
shall remain bound by all of Seller’s and Seller’s assignee’s obligations hereunder and shall retain full 
liability to Buyer for any breach of such obligations, whether such breach is committed by Seller itself or 
by Seller’s assignee. 
12.In the event Seller breaches any of the provisions of this Order, or in the event of any proceedings, 
voluntary or involuntary, in bankruptcy or insolvency by or against Seller, including, without limitation, any 
proceeding for reorganization, arrangement or settlement, or in the event of the appointment of an 
assignee for the benefit of creditors or of a receiver, or in the event any third-party claim is made against 
Buyer in respect of the Goods or in respect of any other merchandise that may be the subject of any other 
purchase order issued by Buyer or any of its affiliates to Seller, Buyer shall be entitled to cancel any 
unfilled part of this Order, without any further liability from Buyer to Seller hereunder whatsoever (it being 
understood and agreed that no such cancellation shall affect any rights or remedies Buyer would 
otherwise have under this Order or applicable law against Seller by reason of any breach by Seller of its 
obligations under this Order or of any warranty made by Seller in respect of the Goods), and Buyer shall 
be entitled, in addition to Buyer’s other rights and remedies under this Order or applicable law, to withhold 
from any payments otherwise due from Buyer to Seller under this Order or otherwise an amount 
estimated by Buyer to be a reasonable reserve for payment to Buyer by Seller of any amounts that are or 
may come due to Buyer from Seller (including any amounts due for breach of contract or warranty) under 
this Order or any other purchase order issued by Buyer or any of its affiliates to Seller. 
13.In addition to and without limitation upon any and all remedies Buyer may have hereunder or 
otherwise, Buyer shall have the rights (a) to recoup any amount due to Buyer or any of its affiliates from 
Seller from any amount due to Seller from Buyer or any of its affiliates, (b) to set off any amount due to 
Page 8of 9
----------------Page (7) Break----------------
Seller from Buyer or any of its affiliates against any amount due to Buyer from Seller (including any 
amount due for breach of contract or warranty) under this Order, under any other contract between the 
two parties, under any contract between Seller and any affiliate of Buyer or by reason of any other legal 
obligation that Seller may have to Buyer or any of its affiliates, and (c) to set off an amount due to Seller 
from Buyer or any of its affiliates under any other contract between the parties, or by reason of any other 
legal obligation that Buyer or any of its affiliates may have to Seller, against any amount due to Buyer or 
any of its affiliates from Seller (including any amount due for breach of contract or warranty) under this 
Order. 
14.Buyer shall have the right in case of fire, vandalism, malicious mischief, other casualty, war, civil 
commotion, embargo, governmental regulation or labor dispute, or any event beyond its reasonable 
control to cancel this Order in whole or in part.
