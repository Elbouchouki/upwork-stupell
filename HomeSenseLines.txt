TERMS AND CONDITIONS
Purchase Order Terms & Conditions
1.The purchase order (the "Order") includes the terms on the Order form, the terms set forth below, the terms of any Continuation to the Order, Supplement to the 
Order, Distribution and Routing Instructions to the Order, the WMI Routing Guide, TJX's Vendor Code of Conduct (provided at www.tjxlogistics.com), the terms 
of any Letter of Credit issued in connection with this Order (or other payment instrument, including wire transfer requirements), as well as all requirements 
provided at www.tjxlogistics.com. The Order (as defined above) constitutes the entire agreement between Winners Merchants International L.P. by its general 
partner WMI-1 Holding Company including all its Canadian affiliates ("Buyer") and the vendor named on the Order form ("Seller") with respect to the Goods 
referenced on the same (the "Goods") and any other subject matter of this Order. By acceptance of this Order, Seller agrees to comply with the Import 
Compliance Program and the Vendor Code of Conduct. Seller also agrees to comply with Buyer's Statement of Policy Concerning Gifts, of which Seller 
acknowledges receipt. Seller agrees to advise its employees of said policies.
2.This Order shall not be effective unless confirmed in writing by an authorized employee of Buyer. Any Goods "put in work" or shipped prior to receipt of such 
written confirmation are at Seller's risk. Time is of the essence with respect to all dates and deadlines set forth in this Order. Seller shall be deemed to accept this 
Order upon the terms stated herein unless Seller shall give written notice of rejection within seven (7) days of the date of this Order. Upon its acceptance by 
Seller in accordance with the preceding sentence, this Order and the terms stated herein shall become a binding agreement between Buyer and Seller. If Seller 
shall accept this Order, but within said seven (7) days offers shipment dates other than those specified by Buyer in this Order or otherwise, Buyer may reject said 
proposed shipment dates, in whole or in part, by oral or written notice to Seller. To the extent (and only to the extent) said proposed shipment dates are not so 
rejected, Seller's proposed shipment dates shall become a part of this Order; this Order shall be deemed amended so as to apply only to that portion of the 
Goods covered by those of Seller's proposed shipment dates that are not rejected by Buyer; and as so amended this Order shall become a binding agreement 
between Seller and Buyer. Except to the limited extent provided for in the preceding sentence, the terms stated in this Order are the only agreement between 
Seller and Buyer relating to the Goods; shall not be varied by any additional or inconsistent terms contained in any invoice, confirmation or other material of 
Seller; and may only be waived or changed by a written agreement signed by an officer of Buyer.
NOTWITHSTANDING ANY LIMITATION TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED IN ANY PRIOR OR SUBSEQUENT OFFER MADE BY SELLER WITH 
RESPECT TO ANY OF THE GOODS, ANY ACCEPTANCE OF ANY SUCH OFFER CREATED BY THIS ORDER OR BY ANY PRIOR OR SUBSEQUENT 
CONDUCT OF BUYER (INCLUDING BUYER'S ACCEPTANCE OF OR PAYMENT FOR ANY OF THE GOODS) IS EXPRESSLY MADE CONDITIONAL ON 
SELLER'S ASSENT TO ANY AND ALL TERMS SET FORTH IN THIS ORDER THAT MAY BE DIFFERENT FROM OR ADDITIONAL TO THE TERMS OF 
SUCH OFFER.
3.No receipt, rejection, acceptance, revocation of acceptance, resale, payment or other action or omission by Buyer of or in respect of the Goods shall bar Buyer 
from at any time exercising any remedies Buyer may have as the result of failure of Seller, or the Goods, to comply with the terms of this Order. Buyer shall have 
no obligation to make payment hereunder prior to acceptance of all Goods ordered hereunder.
4.Receipt by Buyer of any Goods, irrespective of any contrary provisions contained in any document delivered or in any statement made by Seller to Buyer upon 
such receipt, shall not be deemed acceptance. Such receipt shall evidence only the time and place thereof and the quantity of cartons and other shipping 
containers received.
5.At Buyer's option, upon oral or written notice given at any time after discovery thereof, if any part or item of the Goods is not in every respect as required by this 
Order or as warranted herein, or not shipped in compliance with Buyer's shipping directions, the Goods may in whole or in part be rejected and thereupon either 
returned to Seller, at Seller's risk and expense, or held by Buyer for Seller's account, at Seller's risk and expense, or sold by Buyer for Seller's account, at 
Seller's risk and expense or disposed of by Buyer, in each case whether or not any other part or item of the Goods has been previously or may be thereafter 
received or accepted by Buyer. In the event of any such rejection, Buyer shall receive a credit for the amount rejected. In the event Buyer is entitled to reject the 
Goods in whole or in part under the preceding sentence or otherwise, but Buyer nonetheless elects to accept some or all of the Goods, Buyer may retain any 
accepted Goods for its own account and receive a credit from Seller for any of the Goods that Buyer may have elected to reject and for the amount of any 
damages owing to Buyer from Seller in respect of the accepted Goods or any of the Goods that Buyer may have rejected. Until reasonable instructions are 
received from Seller after notice of rejection has been given by Buyer, Buyer is under no duty as to Goods which are perishable or threaten to decline in value 
speedily.
6.Seller warrants that Goods will conform to sample, order specification or standard as to quality, material(s), workmanship, fit and appearance and will be properly 
marked and labeled (including use of the metric system) as to weight, measure, material(s) and ingredients. Seller warrants that the Goods are new, 
merchantable and safe, free from defects in materials or workmanship, and that the handling, wearing or use (including, as applicable, ingestion) of the same will 
not cause harm to any person or damage to the property of any person. Seller agrees that if the Goods are made of materials which require special laundering, 
cleaning, care or handling, they will be plainly marked in a conspicuous place with complete and proper instructions.
7.Seller warrants that it is in compliance with, and that the Goods and their manufacture and shipment to Buyer, will comply with, all international (including country 
of origin), and federal, provincial, and local laws, ordinances, rules and regulations and all applicable industry standards (referred to collectively as "laws") 
applicable to the Goods, or applicable to the advertising, design, distribution, labeling, marking, processing, pricing, production, promotion, sale or testing of the 
Goods, including, but expressly not limited to, laws in the following areas: bribery, consumer product safety, customs, environmental, employment, fair labour, 
forced labour, food and drug, foreign corrupt practices, occupational health and safety, product labeling, sexual harassment and transshipment. In addition, and 
without limiting the foregoing, Seller warrants and Seller agrees to provide Buyer with a signed guarantee in the form, if any, prescribed by such laws before 
payment is required to be made, that the weights, measures, sizes, legends and descriptions, if any, stamped, printed or otherwise attached to the Goods or 
containers or referring to the Goods are correct and comply with such laws.
8.Seller warrants that the Goods and their markings, labels, design and appearance do not infringe any patents, trade dress, trademarks, trade names, copyrights 
or other rights of others, nor unfairly compete therewith, and that the resale thereof by Buyer, to any person, in any place, with or without any such markings, 
labels, design or appearance, is not restricted in any manner whatsoever. Seller further warrants that all Goods bearing any name or trademark of any third party 
are genuine Goods manufactured in accordance with all applicable quality standards of such third party. Seller agrees that all labels containing Buyer's name or 
trademark will be removed from any Goods not received by Buyer. Seller further agrees that all excess labels over amounts required to fill Buyer's orders will be 
either delivered to Buyer without charge or else destroyed, and in no way will said labels be sold or otherwise used.
9.Nothing herein shall operate to exclude Seller's warranties implied by law. No modification or exclusion of any warranty, express or implied, shall be effective 
unless agreed to by Buyer in a separate written instrument executed by Buyer solely for the purpose of such a modification or exclusion. No Seller's warranty 
shall be excluded because of Buyer's inspection of, or failure or refusal to inspect, the Goods. Seller agrees that any damage or loss resulting from any of the 
Goods not being as warranted by Seller will be deemed as having been proximately caused by Seller's warranty breach regardless of whether, or when, Buyer or 
Buyer's customers took action to inspect the Goods. Buyer retains the right to audit and examine current or past compliance with any warranty by Seller in 
respect of the Goods, and Seller shall cooperate (and ensure cooperation by any manufacturer) as required by Buyer. Seller agrees to immediately notify Buyer 
of any circumstance which does or may result in any of the Goods being in violation of any of Seller's warranties in respect of the Goods. Seller agrees to provide 
Buyer any documents or information requested by Buyer, including without limitation, any documents or information related to production of the Goods. Seller 
represents that the Order qualifies under NAFTA and will provide Buyer all certificates and back-up documentation required in connection with such qualification.
10.In the event of any violation of any warranty or other obligation of Seller under this Order or otherwise with respect to any of the Goods, Buyer shall have the 
right to return any or all of the Goods to Seller for full credit and/or to be compensated for any and all loss or damages suffered by Buyer as a result of such 
violation, and/or such return, including but not limited to Buyer's storage costs, freight costs and handling costs in respect of the Goods. Buyer's incidental and 
consequential damages by reason of such violation and/or any such return (it being understood that Buyer's consequential damages shall include without 
limitation Buyer's lost profits on resale of the Goods and shall be calculated without regard to whether Buyer could have covered or did cover by acquiring 
substitute Goods), and all other costs and expenses associated with such violation or any such return. Seller agrees, at Buyer's request, to assume the defense 
of any suit or claim brought or made against Buyer or any of its affiliates by any third party arising out of or resulting directly or indirectly from any circumstance 
constituting (or which if proven would constitute) a failure or alleged failure of Seller or the Goods to conform to the terms of any obligation of Seller or any 
warranty made by Seller hereunder, and Seller shall be obliged to indemnify Buyer against all loss and expense, including counsel fees and costs of defending, 
incurred by Buyer as a result of any such third-party suit or claim that Buyer may request Seller to assume the defense of (it being understood that Buyer shall 
have the right to approve any settlement of such suit or claim). In the alternative, at Buyer's option, and in Buyer's sole discretion, Buyer may retain full control 
over the defense and settlement of any such third-party suit or claim and may require Seller to cooperate in such defense and settlement, all at Seller's expense, 
including counsel fees, and in such event Seller shall indemnify Buyer against all loss and expense, including counsel fees and the costs of defending, resulting 
from such third-party suit or claim. Seller's indemnity hereunder shall be in favour of Buyer, any company or organization (including any partnership and limited 
liability organization) controlling, controlled by or under common control with Buyer (such companies or organizations sometimes referred to herein as 
"affiliates"), and each of the agents of Buyer and its affiliates. Any action by Seller for breach of this Order must be commenced, and Buyer must be served with 
process in any such action, within a year of the date of breach. All suits or proceedings by Seller against Buyer or any of its affiliates or any of the agents of 
Buyer and its affiliates based upon or arising out of or relating to this Order or the Goods shall be brought or maintained only in courts of proper jurisdiction 
located in the Province of Ontario. Seller agrees to maintain sufficient insurance for general liability coverage with an endorsement for products liability either 
naming Buyer as additional insured, or broad form vendors coverage wherein Buyer becomes a certificate holder with respect to any Goods purchased 
hereunder, and such a certificate shall be provided, at Buyer's request. Failure of Buyer to request or of Seller to provide a certificate of insurance shall not be 
construed to result in a waiver of any of Buyer's rights or Seller's obligations hereunder. Seller agrees to indemnify and hold Buyer and its affiliates and the 
agents of Buyer and its affiliates harmless from and against all claims or suits from third parties, including, without limitation, Buyer's customers, and all loss and 
expense resulting therefrom, based upon or arising from or related to injuries to persons or damage to property caused, or alleged to be caused, by any defect in 
the Goods.
11.If any rights of Seller hereunder shall be assigned then, even after notice to Buyer of such assignment, the assignee shall be bound by, and subject to, any 
defenses which Buyer may have against Seller and any agreements made by Buyer and Seller regarding the Goods or payment therefor, whether such defenses 
and agreements come into existence before or after such assignment (including, without limitation, any claims for defects or returns, any allowances or credits, 
and any offsets that Buyer may have against the original Seller). Notwithstanding any such assignment, Seller shall remain bound by all of Seller's and Seller's 
assignee's obligation hereunder and shall retain full liability to Buyer for any breach of such obligations, whether such breach is committed by Seller itself or by 
Seller's assignee.
12.In the event Seller breaches any of the provisions of this Order, or in the event of any proceedings, voluntary or involuntary, in bankruptcy or insolvency by or 
against Seller, including, without limitation, any proceeding for reorganization, arrangement or settlement, or in the event of the appointment of an assignee for 
the benefit of creditors or of a receiver, Buyer shall be entitled to cancel any unfilled part of this Order without any liability whatsoever and Buyer shall be entitled 
to withhold from any payments due from Buyer an amount estimated by Buyer to be a reasonable reserve for payment to Buyer of any future claims against 
Seller for returns, defects and the like.
13.In addition to and without limitation upon any and all remedies Buyer may have hereunder or otherwise, Buyer shall have the right (a) to recoup any amount due 
to Buyer or any of its, affiliates from Seller from any amount due to Seller from Buyer or any of its affiliates, (b) to set off any amount due to Seller from Buyer or 
any of its affiliates against any amount due to Buyer from Seller (including any amount due for breach of contract or warranty) under this Order, under any other 
contract between the two parties, under any contract between Seller and any affiliate of Buyer or by reason of any other legal obligation that Seller may have to 
Buyer or any of its affiliates, and (c) to set off any amount due to Seller from Buyer or any of affiliates under any other contract between the parties, or by reason 
of any other legal obligation that Buyer or any of its affiliates may have to Seller, against any amount due to Buyer or any of its affiliates from Seller (including 
any amount due to breach of contract or warranty) under this Order.
14.Buyer reserves the right in case of fire, vandalism, malicious mischief, other casualty, war, civil commotion, embargo, governmental regulation or labour dispute, 
or any event beyond its reasonable control to cancel this Order in whole or in part.
15.Title to the Goods and risk of loss or damage shall pass to Buyer at the F.O.B. point on the face of the Order form.

17.This Order, and any claim arising under, based upon, or relating to this Order or the transaction contemplated by this Order, shall be governed by and construed 
and enforced in accordance with the laws of the Province of Ontario, but without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would cause 
application of the law of any other jurisdiction. All rights and remedies of Buyer provided for herein shall be cumulative to one another and cumulative to any 
rights and remedies to which Buyer is entitled by law. Nothing herein shall exclude or limit any other rights and remedies to which Buyer is entitled by law. The 
invalidity of any provision hereof shall not affect the validity of any other provision, and the failure to enforce any provision herein as to any of the Goods shall not 
be deemed a waiver of such enforcement as to such Goods or as to any of the other Goods.
18.The parties have required that this document and all instruments relating thereto be drawn in the English language; Les parties aux présentes ont exigé que ce 
document et tout autre document, qui y sont afférents soient rédigés en langue anglaise.

of any Letter of Credit issued in connection with this Order (or other payment instrument, including wire transfer requirements), as well as all requirements 
provided at www.tjxlogistics.com. The Order (as defined above) constitutes the entire agreement between Winners Merchants International L.P. by its general 
partner WMI-1 Holding Company including all its Canadian affiliates ("Buyer") and the vendor named on the Order form ("Seller") with respect to the Goods 
referenced on the same (the "Goods") and any other subject matter of this Order. By acceptance of this Order, Seller agrees to comply with the Import 
Compliance Program and the Vendor Code of Conduct. Seller also agrees to comply with Buyer's Statement of Policy Concerning Gifts, of which Seller 
acknowledges receipt. Seller agrees to advise its employees of said policies.
2.This Order shall not be effective unless confirmed in writing by an authorized employee of Buyer. Any Goods "put in work" or shipped prior to receipt of such 
written confirmation are at Seller's risk. Time is of the essence with respect to all dates and deadlines set forth in this Order. Seller shall be deemed to accept this 
Order upon the terms stated herein unless Seller shall give written notice of rejection within seven (7) days of the date of this Order. Upon its acceptance by 
Seller in accordance with the preceding sentence, this Order and the terms stated herein shall become a binding agreement between Buyer and Seller. If Seller 
shall accept this Order, but within said seven (7) days offers shipment dates other than those specified by Buyer in this Order or otherwise, Buyer may reject said 
proposed shipment dates, in whole or in part, by oral or written notice to Seller. To the extent (and only to the extent) said proposed shipment dates are not so 
rejected, Seller's proposed shipment dates shall become a part of this Order; this Order shall be deemed amended so as to apply only to that portion of the 
Goods covered by those of Seller's proposed shipment dates that are not rejected by Buyer; and as so amended this Order shall become a binding agreement 
between Seller and Buyer. Except to the limited extent provided for in the preceding sentence, the terms stated in this Order are the only agreement between 
Seller and Buyer relating to the Goods; shall not be varied by any additional or inconsistent terms contained in any invoice, confirmation or other material of 
Seller; and may only be waived or changed by a written agreement signed by an officer of Buyer.
NOTWITHSTANDING ANY LIMITATION TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED IN ANY PRIOR OR SUBSEQUENT OFFER MADE BY SELLER WITH 
RESPECT TO ANY OF THE GOODS, ANY ACCEPTANCE OF ANY SUCH OFFER CREATED BY THIS ORDER OR BY ANY PRIOR OR SUBSEQUENT 
CONDUCT OF BUYER (INCLUDING BUYER'S ACCEPTANCE OF OR PAYMENT FOR ANY OF THE GOODS) IS EXPRESSLY MADE CONDITIONAL ON 
SELLER'S ASSENT TO ANY AND ALL TERMS SET FORTH IN THIS ORDER THAT MAY BE DIFFERENT FROM OR ADDITIONAL TO THE TERMS OF 
SUCH OFFER.
3.No receipt, rejection, acceptance, revocation of acceptance, resale, payment or other action or omission by Buyer of or in respect of the Goods shall bar Buyer 
from at any time exercising any remedies Buyer may have as the result of failure of Seller, or the Goods, to comply with the terms of this Order. Buyer shall have 
no obligation to make payment hereunder prior to acceptance of all Goods ordered hereunder.
4.Receipt by Buyer of any Goods, irrespective of any contrary provisions contained in any document delivered or in any statement made by Seller to Buyer upon 
such receipt, shall not be deemed acceptance. Such receipt shall evidence only the time and place thereof and the quantity of cartons and other shipping 
containers received.
5.At Buyer's option, upon oral or written notice given at any time after discovery thereof, if any part or item of the Goods is not in every respect as required by this 
Order or as warranted herein, or not shipped in compliance with Buyer's shipping directions, the Goods may in whole or in part be rejected and thereupon either 
returned to Seller, at Seller's risk and expense, or held by Buyer for Seller's account, at Seller's risk and expense, or sold by Buyer for Seller's account, at 
Seller's risk and expense or disposed of by Buyer, in each case whether or not any other part or item of the Goods has been previously or may be thereafter 
received or accepted by Buyer. In the event of any such rejection, Buyer shall receive a credit for the amount rejected. In the event Buyer is entitled to reject the 
Goods in whole or in part under the preceding sentence or otherwise, but Buyer nonetheless elects to accept some or all of the Goods, Buyer may retain any 
accepted Goods for its own account and receive a credit from Seller for any of the Goods that Buyer may have elected to reject and for the amount of any 
damages owing to Buyer from Seller in respect of the accepted Goods or any of the Goods that Buyer may have rejected. Until reasonable instructions are 
received from Seller after notice of rejection has been given by Buyer, Buyer is under no duty as to Goods which are perishable or threaten to decline in value 
speedily.
6.Seller warrants that Goods will conform to sample, order specification or standard as to quality, material(s), workmanship, fit and appearance and will be properly 
marked and labeled (including use of the metric system) as to weight, measure, material(s) and ingredients. Seller warrants that the Goods are new, 
merchantable and safe, free from defects in materials or workmanship, and that the handling, wearing or use (including, as applicable, ingestion) of the same will 
not cause harm to any person or damage to the property of any person. Seller agrees that if the Goods are made of materials which require special laundering, 
cleaning, care or handling, they will be plainly marked in a conspicuous place with complete and proper instructions.
7.Seller warrants that it is in compliance with, and that the Goods and their manufacture and shipment to Buyer, will comply with, all international (including country 
of origin), and federal, provincial, and local laws, ordinances, rules and regulations and all applicable industry standards (referred to collectively as "laws") 
applicable to the Goods, or applicable to the advertising, design, distribution, labeling, marking, processing, pricing, production, promotion, sale or testing of the 
Goods, including, but expressly not limited to, laws in the following areas: bribery, consumer product safety, customs, environmental, employment, fair labour, 
forced labour, food and drug, foreign corrupt practices, occupational health and safety, product labeling, sexual harassment and transshipment. In addition, and 
without limiting the foregoing, Seller warrants and Seller agrees to provide Buyer with a signed guarantee in the form, if any, prescribed by such laws before 
payment is required to be made, that the weights, measures, sizes, legends and descriptions, if any, stamped, printed or otherwise attached to the Goods or 
containers or referring to the Goods are correct and comply with such laws.
8.Seller warrants that the Goods and their markings, labels, design and appearance do not infringe any patents, trade dress, trademarks, trade names, copyrights 
or other rights of others, nor unfairly compete therewith, and that the resale thereof by Buyer, to any person, in any place, with or without any such markings, 
labels, design or appearance, is not restricted in any manner whatsoever. Seller further warrants that all Goods bearing any name or trademark of any third party 
are genuine Goods manufactured in accordance with all applicable quality standards of such third party. Seller agrees that all labels containing Buyer's name or 
trademark will be removed from any Goods not received by Buyer. Seller further agrees that all excess labels over amounts required to fill Buyer's orders will be 
either delivered to Buyer without charge or else destroyed, and in no way will said labels be sold or otherwise used.
9.Nothing herein shall operate to exclude Seller's warranties implied by law. No modification or exclusion of any warranty, express or implied, shall be effective 
unless agreed to by Buyer in a separate written instrument executed by Buyer solely for the purpose of such a modification or exclusion. No Seller's warranty 
shall be excluded because of Buyer's inspection of, or failure or refusal to inspect, the Goods. Seller agrees that any damage or loss resulting from any of the 
Goods not being as warranted by Seller will be deemed as having been proximately caused by Seller's warranty breach regardless of whether, or when, Buyer or 
Buyer's customers took action to inspect the Goods. Buyer retains the right to audit and examine current or past compliance with any warranty by Seller in 
respect of the Goods, and Seller shall cooperate (and ensure cooperation by any manufacturer) as required by Buyer. Seller agrees to immediately notify Buyer 
of any circumstance which does or may result in any of the Goods being in violation of any of Seller's warranties in respect of the Goods. Seller agrees to provide 
Buyer any documents or information requested by Buyer, including without limitation, any documents or information related to production of the Goods. Seller 
represents that the Order qualifies under NAFTA and will provide Buyer all certificates and back-up documentation required in connection with such qualification.
10.In the event of any violation of any warranty or other obligation of Seller under this Order or otherwise with respect to any of the Goods, Buyer shall have the 
right to return any or all of the Goods to Seller for full credit and/or to be compensated for any and all loss or damages suffered by Buyer as a result of such 
violation, and/or such return, including but not limited to Buyer's storage costs, freight costs and handling costs in respect of the Goods. Buyer's incidental and 
consequential damages by reason of such violation and/or any such return (it being understood that Buyer's consequential damages shall include without 
limitation Buyer's lost profits on resale of the Goods and shall be calculated without regard to whether Buyer could have covered or did cover by acquiring 
substitute Goods), and all other costs and expenses associated with such violation or any such return. Seller agrees, at Buyer's request, to assume the defense 
of any suit or claim brought or made against Buyer or any of its affiliates by any third party arising out of or resulting directly or indirectly from any circumstance 
constituting (or which if proven would constitute) a failure or alleged failure of Seller or the Goods to conform to the terms of any obligation of Seller or any 
warranty made by Seller hereunder, and Seller shall be obliged to indemnify Buyer against all loss and expense, including counsel fees and costs of defending, 
incurred by Buyer as a result of any such third-party suit or claim that Buyer may request Seller to assume the defense of (it being understood that Buyer shall 
have the right to approve any settlement of such suit or claim). In the alternative, at Buyer's option, and in Buyer's sole discretion, Buyer may retain full control 
over the defense and settlement of any such third-party suit or claim and may require Seller to cooperate in such defense and settlement, all at Seller's expense, 
including counsel fees, and in such event Seller shall indemnify Buyer against all loss and expense, including counsel fees and the costs of defending, resulting 
from such third-party suit or claim. Seller's indemnity hereunder shall be in favour of Buyer, any company or organization (including any partnership and limited 
liability organization) controlling, controlled by or under common control with Buyer (such companies or organizations sometimes referred to herein as 
"affiliates"), and each of the agents of Buyer and its affiliates. Any action by Seller for breach of this Order must be commenced, and Buyer must be served with 
process in any such action, within a year of the date of breach. All suits or proceedings by Seller against Buyer or any of its affiliates or any of the agents of 
Buyer and its affiliates based upon or arising out of or relating to this Order or the Goods shall be brought or maintained only in courts of proper jurisdiction 
located in the Province of Ontario. Seller agrees to maintain sufficient insurance for general liability coverage with an endorsement for products liability either 
naming Buyer as additional insured, or broad form vendors coverage wherein Buyer becomes a certificate holder with respect to any Goods purchased 
hereunder, and such a certificate shall be provided, at Buyer's request. Failure of Buyer to request or of Seller to provide a certificate of insurance shall not be 
construed to result in a waiver of any of Buyer's rights or Seller's obligations hereunder. Seller agrees to indemnify and hold Buyer and its affiliates and the 
agents of Buyer and its affiliates harmless from and against all claims or suits from third parties, including, without limitation, Buyer's customers, and all loss and 
expense resulting therefrom, based upon or arising from or related to injuries to persons or damage to property caused, or alleged to be caused, by any defect in 
the Goods.
11.If any rights of Seller hereunder shall be assigned then, even after notice to Buyer of such assignment, the assignee shall be bound by, and subject to, any 
defenses which Buyer may have against Seller and any agreements made by Buyer and Seller regarding the Goods or payment therefor, whether such defenses 
and agreements come into existence before or after such assignment (including, without limitation, any claims for defects or returns, any allowances or credits, 
and any offsets that Buyer may have against the original Seller). Notwithstanding any such assignment, Seller shall remain bound by all of Seller's and Seller's 
assignee's obligation hereunder and shall retain full liability to Buyer for any breach of such obligations, whether such breach is committed by Seller itself or by 
Seller's assignee.
12.In the event Seller breaches any of the provisions of this Order, or in the event of any proceedings, voluntary or involuntary, in bankruptcy or insolvency by or 
against Seller, including, without limitation, any proceeding for reorganization, arrangement or settlement, or in the event of the appointment of an assignee for 
the benefit of creditors or of a receiver, Buyer shall be entitled to cancel any unfilled part of this Order without any liability whatsoever and Buyer shall be entitled 
to withhold from any payments due from Buyer an amount estimated by Buyer to be a reasonable reserve for payment to Buyer of any future claims against 
Seller for returns, defects and the like.
13.In addition to and without limitation upon any and all remedies Buyer may have hereunder or otherwise, Buyer shall have the right (a) to recoup any amount due 
to Buyer or any of its, affiliates from Seller from any amount due to Seller from Buyer or any of its affiliates, (b) to set off any amount due to Seller from Buyer or 
any of its affiliates against any amount due to Buyer from Seller (including any amount due for breach of contract or warranty) under this Order, under any other 
contract between the two parties, under any contract between Seller and any affiliate of Buyer or by reason of any other legal obligation that Seller may have to 
Buyer or any of its affiliates, and (c) to set off any amount due to Seller from Buyer or any of affiliates under any other contract between the parties, or by reason 
of any other legal obligation that Buyer or any of its affiliates may have to Seller, against any amount due to Buyer or any of its affiliates from Seller (including 
any amount due to breach of contract or warranty) under this Order.
14.Buyer reserves the right in case of fire, vandalism, malicious mischief, other casualty, war, civil commotion, embargo, governmental regulation or labour dispute, 
or any event beyond its reasonable control to cancel this Order in whole or in part.
15.Title to the Goods and risk of loss or damage shall pass to Buyer at the F.O.B. point on the face of the Order form.

17.This Order, and any claim arising under, based upon, or relating to this Order or the transaction contemplated by this Order, shall be governed by and construed 
and enforced in accordance with the laws of the Province of Ontario, but without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would cause 
application of the law of any other jurisdiction. All rights and remedies of Buyer provided for herein shall be cumulative to one another and cumulative to any 
rights and remedies to which Buyer is entitled by law. Nothing herein shall exclude or limit any other rights and remedies to which Buyer is entitled by law. The 
invalidity of any provision hereof shall not affect the validity of any other provision, and the failure to enforce any provision herein as to any of the Goods shall not 
be deemed a waiver of such enforcement as to such Goods or as to any of the other Goods.
18.The parties have required that this document and all instruments relating thereto be drawn in the English language; Les parties aux présentes ont exigé que ce 
document et tout autre document, qui y sont afférents soient rédigés en langue anglaise.

over the defense and settlement of any such third-party suit or claim and may require Seller to cooperate in such defense and settlement, all at Seller's expense, 
including counsel fees, and in such event Seller shall indemnify Buyer against all loss and expense, including counsel fees and the costs of defending, resulting

TERMS AND CONDITIONS
Purchase Order Terms & Conditions
1.The purchase order (the "Order") includes the terms on the Order form, the terms set forth below, the terms of any Continuation to the Order, Supplement to the 
Order, Distribution and Routing Instructions to the Order, the WMI Routing Guide, TJX's Vendor Code of Conduct (provided at www.tjxlogistics.com), the terms 
of any Letter of Credit issued in connection with this Order (or other payment instrument, including wire transfer requirements), as well as all requirements 
provided at www.tjxlogistics.com. The Order (as defined above) constitutes the entire agreement between Winners Merchants International L.P. by its general 
partner WMI-1 Holding Company including all its Canadian affiliates ("Buyer") and the vendor named on the Order form ("Seller") with respect to the Goods 
referenced on the same (the "Goods") and any other subject matter of this Order. By acceptance of this Order, Seller agrees to comply with the Import 
Compliance Program and the Vendor Code of Conduct. Seller also agrees to comply with Buyer's Statement of Policy Concerning Gifts, of which Seller 
acknowledges receipt. Seller agrees to advise its employees of said policies.
2.This Order shall not be effective unless confirmed in writing by an authorized employee of Buyer. Any Goods "put in work" or shipped prior to receipt of such 
written confirmation are at Seller's risk. Time is of the essence with respect to all dates and deadlines set forth in this Order. Seller shall be deemed to accept this 
Order upon the terms stated herein unless Seller shall give written notice of rejection within seven (7) days of the date of this Order. Upon its acceptance by 
Seller in accordance with the preceding sentence, this Order and the terms stated herein shall become a binding agreement between Buyer and Seller. If Seller 
shall accept this Order, but within said seven (7) days offers shipment dates other than those specified by Buyer in this Order or otherwise, Buyer may reject said 
proposed shipment dates, in whole or in part, by oral or written notice to Seller. To the extent (and only to the extent) said proposed shipment dates are not so 
rejected, Seller's proposed shipment dates shall become a part of this Order; this Order shall be deemed amended so as to apply only to that portion of the 
Goods covered by those of Seller's proposed shipment dates that are not rejected by Buyer; and as so amended this Order shall become a binding agreement 
between Seller and Buyer. Except to the limited extent provided for in the preceding sentence, the terms stated in this Order are the only agreement between 
Seller and Buyer relating to the Goods; shall not be varied by any additional or inconsistent terms contained in any invoice, confirmation or other material of 
Seller; and may only be waived or changed by a written agreement signed by an officer of Buyer.
NOTWITHSTANDING ANY LIMITATION TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED IN ANY PRIOR OR SUBSEQUENT OFFER MADE BY SELLER WITH 
RESPECT TO ANY OF THE GOODS, ANY ACCEPTANCE OF ANY SUCH OFFER CREATED BY THIS ORDER OR BY ANY PRIOR OR SUBSEQUENT 
CONDUCT OF BUYER (INCLUDING BUYER'S ACCEPTANCE OF OR PAYMENT FOR ANY OF THE GOODS) IS EXPRESSLY MADE CONDITIONAL ON 
SELLER'S ASSENT TO ANY AND ALL TERMS SET FORTH IN THIS ORDER THAT MAY BE DIFFERENT FROM OR ADDITIONAL TO THE TERMS OF 
SUCH OFFER.
3.No receipt, rejection, acceptance, revocation of acceptance, resale, payment or other action or omission by Buyer of or in respect of the Goods shall bar Buyer 
from at any time exercising any remedies Buyer may have as the result of failure of Seller, or the Goods, to comply with the terms of this Order. Buyer shall have 
no obligation to make payment hereunder prior to acceptance of all Goods ordered hereunder.
4.Receipt by Buyer of any Goods, irrespective of any contrary provisions contained in any document delivered or in any statement made by Seller to Buyer upon 
such receipt, shall not be deemed acceptance. Such receipt shall evidence only the time and place thereof and the quantity of cartons and other shipping 
containers received.
5.At Buyer's option, upon oral or written notice given at any time after discovery thereof, if any part or item of the Goods is not in every respect as required by this 
Order or as warranted herein, or not shipped in compliance with Buyer's shipping directions, the Goods may in whole or in part be rejected and thereupon either 
returned to Seller, at Seller's risk and expense, or held by Buyer for Seller's account, at Seller's risk and expense, or sold by Buyer for Seller's account, at 
Seller's risk and expense or disposed of by Buyer, in each case whether or not any other part or item of the Goods has been previously or may be thereafter 
received or accepted by Buyer. In the event of any such rejection, Buyer shall receive a credit for the amount rejected. In the event Buyer is entitled to reject the 
Goods in whole or in part under the preceding sentence or otherwise, but Buyer nonetheless elects to accept some or all of the Goods, Buyer may retain any 
accepted Goods for its own account and receive a credit from Seller for any of the Goods that Buyer may have elected to reject and for the amount of any 
damages owing to Buyer from Seller in respect of the accepted Goods or any of the Goods that Buyer may have rejected. Until reasonable instructions are 
received from Seller after notice of rejection has been given by Buyer, Buyer is under no duty as to Goods which are perishable or threaten to decline in value 
speedily.
6.Seller warrants that Goods will conform to sample, order specification or standard as to quality, material(s), workmanship, fit and appearance and will be properly 
marked and labeled (including use of the metric system) as to weight, measure, material(s) and ingredients. Seller warrants that the Goods are new, 
merchantable and safe, free from defects in materials or workmanship, and that the handling, wearing or use (including, as applicable, ingestion) of the same will 
not cause harm to any person or damage to the property of any person. Seller agrees that if the Goods are made of materials which require special laundering, 
cleaning, care or handling, they will be plainly marked in a conspicuous place with complete and proper instructions.
7.Seller warrants that it is in compliance with, and that the Goods and their manufacture and shipment to Buyer, will comply with, all international (including country 
of origin), and federal, provincial, and local laws, ordinances, rules and regulations and all applicable industry standards (referred to collectively as "laws") 
applicable to the Goods, or applicable to the advertising, design, distribution, labeling, marking, processing, pricing, production, promotion, sale or testing of the 
Goods, including, but expressly not limited to, laws in the following areas: bribery, consumer product safety, customs, environmental, employment, fair labour, 
forced labour, food and drug, foreign corrupt practices, occupational health and safety, product labeling, sexual harassment and transshipment. In addition, and 
without limiting the foregoing, Seller warrants and Seller agrees to provide Buyer with a signed guarantee in the form, if any, prescribed by such laws before 
payment is required to be made, that the weights, measures, sizes, legends and descriptions, if any, stamped, printed or otherwise attached to the Goods or 
containers or referring to the Goods are correct and comply with such laws.
8.Seller warrants that the Goods and their markings, labels, design and appearance do not infringe any patents, trade dress, trademarks, trade names, copyrights 
or other rights of others, nor unfairly compete therewith, and that the resale thereof by Buyer, to any person, in any place, with or without any such markings, 
labels, design or appearance, is not restricted in any manner whatsoever. Seller further warrants that all Goods bearing any name or trademark of any third party 
are genuine Goods manufactured in accordance with all applicable quality standards of such third party. Seller agrees that all labels containing Buyer's name or 
trademark will be removed from any Goods not received by Buyer. Seller further agrees that all excess labels over amounts required to fill Buyer's orders will be 
either delivered to Buyer without charge or else destroyed, and in no way will said labels be sold or otherwise used.
9.Nothing herein shall operate to exclude Seller's warranties implied by law. No modification or exclusion of any warranty, express or implied, shall be effective 
unless agreed to by Buyer in a separate written instrument executed by Buyer solely for the purpose of such a modification or exclusion. No Seller's warranty 
shall be excluded because of Buyer's inspection of, or failure or refusal to inspect, the Goods. Seller agrees that any damage or loss resulting from any of the 
Goods not being as warranted by Seller will be deemed as having been proximately caused by Seller's warranty breach regardless of whether, or when, Buyer or 
Buyer's customers took action to inspect the Goods. Buyer retains the right to audit and examine current or past compliance with any warranty by Seller in 
respect of the Goods, and Seller shall cooperate (and ensure cooperation by any manufacturer) as required by Buyer. Seller agrees to immediately notify Buyer 
of any circumstance which does or may result in any of the Goods being in violation of any of Seller's warranties in respect of the Goods. Seller agrees to provide 
Buyer any documents or information requested by Buyer, including without limitation, any documents or information related to production of the Goods. Seller 
represents that the Order qualifies under NAFTA and will provide Buyer all certificates and back-up documentation required in connection with such qualification.
10.In the event of any violation of any warranty or other obligation of Seller under this Order or otherwise with respect to any of the Goods, Buyer shall have the 
right to return any or all of the Goods to Seller for full credit and/or to be compensated for any and all loss or damages suffered by Buyer as a result of such 
violation, and/or such return, including but not limited to Buyer's storage costs, freight costs and handling costs in respect of the Goods. Buyer's incidental and 
consequential damages by reason of such violation and/or any such return (it being understood that Buyer's consequential damages shall include without 
limitation Buyer's lost profits on resale of the Goods and shall be calculated without regard to whether Buyer could have covered or did cover by acquiring 
substitute Goods), and all other costs and expenses associated with such violation or any such return. Seller agrees, at Buyer's request, to assume the defense 
of any suit or claim brought or made against Buyer or any of its affiliates by any third party arising out of or resulting directly or indirectly from any circumstance 
constituting (or which if proven would constitute) a failure or alleged failure of Seller or the Goods to conform to the terms of any obligation of Seller or any 
warranty made by Seller hereunder, and Seller shall be obliged to indemnify Buyer against all loss and expense, including counsel fees and costs of defending, 
incurred by Buyer as a result of any such third-party suit or claim that Buyer may request Seller to assume the defense of (it being understood that Buyer shall 
have the right to approve any settlement of such suit or claim). In the alternative, at Buyer's option, and in Buyer's sole discretion, Buyer may retain full control 
over the defense and settlement of any such third-party suit or claim and may require Seller to cooperate in such defense and settlement, all at Seller's expense, 
including counsel fees, and in such event Seller shall indemnify Buyer against all loss and expense, including counsel fees and the costs of defending, resulting 
from such third-party suit or claim. Seller's indemnity hereunder shall be in favour of Buyer, any company or organization (including any partnership and limited 
liability organization) controlling, controlled by or under common control with Buyer (such companies or organizations sometimes referred to herein as

located in the Province of Ontario. Seller agrees to maintain sufficient insurance for general liability coverage with an endorsement for products liability either 
naming Buyer as additional insured, or broad form vendors coverage wherein Buyer becomes a certificate holder with respect to any Goods purchased 
hereunder, and such a certificate shall be provided, at Buyer's request. Failure of Buyer to request or of Seller to provide a certificate of insurance shall not be 
construed to result in a waiver of any of Buyer's rights or Seller's obligations hereunder. Seller agrees to indemnify and hold Buyer and its affiliates and the 
agents of Buyer and its affiliates harmless from and against all claims or suits from third parties, including, without limitation, Buyer's customers, and all loss and 
expense resulting therefrom, based upon or arising from or related to injuries to persons or damage to property caused, or alleged to be caused, by any defect in

TERMS AND CONDITIONS
Purchase Order Terms & Conditions
1.The purchase order (the "Order") includes the terms on the Order form, the terms set forth below, the terms of any Continuation to the Order, Supplement to the 
Order, Distribution and Routing Instructions to the Order, the WMI Routing Guide, TJX's Vendor Code of Conduct (provided at www.tjxlogistics.com), the terms 
of any Letter of Credit issued in connection with this Order (or other payment instrument, including wire transfer requirements), as well as all requirements 
provided at www.tjxlogistics.com. The Order (as defined above) constitutes the entire agreement between Winners Merchants International L.P. by its general 
partner WMI-1 Holding Company including all its Canadian affiliates ("Buyer") and the vendor named on the Order form ("Seller") with respect to the Goods 
referenced on the same (the "Goods") and any other subject matter of this Order. By acceptance of this Order, Seller agrees to comply with the Import 
Compliance Program and the Vendor Code of Conduct. Seller also agrees to comply with Buyer's Statement of Policy Concerning Gifts, of which Seller 
acknowledges receipt. Seller agrees to advise its employees of said policies.
2.This Order shall not be effective unless confirmed in writing by an authorized employee of Buyer. Any Goods "put in work" or shipped prior to receipt of such 
written confirmation are at Seller's risk. Time is of the essence with respect to all dates and deadlines set forth in this Order. Seller shall be deemed to accept this 
Order upon the terms stated herein unless Seller shall give written notice of rejection within seven (7) days of the date of this Order. Upon its acceptance by 
Seller in accordance with the preceding sentence, this Order and the terms stated herein shall become a binding agreement between Buyer and Seller. If Seller 
shall accept this Order, but within said seven (7) days offers shipment dates other than those specified by Buyer in this Order or otherwise, Buyer may reject said 
proposed shipment dates, in whole or in part, by oral or written notice to Seller. To the extent (and only to the extent) said proposed shipment dates are not so 
rejected, Seller's proposed shipment dates shall become a part of this Order; this Order shall be deemed amended so as to apply only to that portion of the 
Goods covered by those of Seller's proposed shipment dates that are not rejected by Buyer; and as so amended this Order shall become a binding agreement 
between Seller and Buyer. Except to the limited extent provided for in the preceding sentence, the terms stated in this Order are the only agreement between 
Seller and Buyer relating to the Goods; shall not be varied by any additional or inconsistent terms contained in any invoice, confirmation or other material of 
Seller; and may only be waived or changed by a written agreement signed by an officer of Buyer.
NOTWITHSTANDING ANY LIMITATION TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED IN ANY PRIOR OR SUBSEQUENT OFFER MADE BY SELLER WITH 
RESPECT TO ANY OF THE GOODS, ANY ACCEPTANCE OF ANY SUCH OFFER CREATED BY THIS ORDER OR BY ANY PRIOR OR SUBSEQUENT 
CONDUCT OF BUYER (INCLUDING BUYER'S ACCEPTANCE OF OR PAYMENT FOR ANY OF THE GOODS) IS EXPRESSLY MADE CONDITIONAL ON 
SELLER'S ASSENT TO ANY AND ALL TERMS SET FORTH IN THIS ORDER THAT MAY BE DIFFERENT FROM OR ADDITIONAL TO THE TERMS OF 
SUCH OFFER.
3.No receipt, rejection, acceptance, revocation of acceptance, resale, payment or other action or omission by Buyer of or in respect of the Goods shall bar Buyer 
from at any time exercising any remedies Buyer may have as the result of failure of Seller, or the Goods, to comply with the terms of this Order. Buyer shall have 
no obligation to make payment hereunder prior to acceptance of all Goods ordered hereunder.
4.Receipt by Buyer of any Goods, irrespective of any contrary provisions contained in any document delivered or in any statement made by Seller to Buyer upon 
such receipt, shall not be deemed acceptance. Such receipt shall evidence only the time and place thereof and the quantity of cartons and other shipping 
containers received.
5.At Buyer's option, upon oral or written notice given at any time after discovery thereof, if any part or item of the Goods is not in every respect as required by this 
Order or as warranted herein, or not shipped in compliance with Buyer's shipping directions, the Goods may in whole or in part be rejected and thereupon either 
returned to Seller, at Seller's risk and expense, or held by Buyer for Seller's account, at Seller's risk and expense, or sold by Buyer for Seller's account, at 
Seller's risk and expense or disposed of by Buyer, in each case whether or not any other part or item of the Goods has been previously or may be thereafter 
received or accepted by Buyer. In the event of any such rejection, Buyer shall receive a credit for the amount rejected. In the event Buyer is entitled to reject the 
Goods in whole or in part under the preceding sentence or otherwise, but Buyer nonetheless elects to accept some or all of the Goods, Buyer may retain any 
accepted Goods for its own account and receive a credit from Seller for any of the Goods that Buyer may have elected to reject and for the amount of any 
damages owing to Buyer from Seller in respect of the accepted Goods or any of the Goods that Buyer may have rejected. Until reasonable instructions are 
received from Seller after notice of rejection has been given by Buyer, Buyer is under no duty as to Goods which are perishable or threaten to decline in value 
speedily.
6.Seller warrants that Goods will conform to sample, order specification or standard as to quality, material(s), workmanship, fit and appearance and will be properly 
marked and labeled (including use of the metric system) as to weight, measure, material(s) and ingredients. Seller warrants that the Goods are new, 
merchantable and safe, free from defects in materials or workmanship, and that the handling, wearing or use (including, as applicable, ingestion) of the same will 
not cause harm to any person or damage to the property of any person. Seller agrees that if the Goods are made of materials which require special laundering, 
cleaning, care or handling, they will be plainly marked in a conspicuous place with complete and proper instructions.
7.Seller warrants that it is in compliance with, and that the Goods and their manufacture and shipment to Buyer, will comply with, all international (including country 
of origin), and federal, provincial, and local laws, ordinances, rules and regulations and all applicable industry standards (referred to collectively as "laws") 
applicable to the Goods, or applicable to the advertising, design, distribution, labeling, marking, processing, pricing, production, promotion, sale or testing of the 
Goods, including, but expressly not limited to, laws in the following areas: bribery, consumer product safety, customs, environmental, employment, fair labour, 
forced labour, food and drug, foreign corrupt practices, occupational health and safety, product labeling, sexual harassment and transshipment. In addition, and 
without limiting the foregoing, Seller warrants and Seller agrees to provide Buyer with a signed guarantee in the form, if any, prescribed by such laws before 
payment is required to be made, that the weights, measures, sizes, legends and descriptions, if any, stamped, printed or otherwise attached to the Goods or 
containers or referring to the Goods are correct and comply with such laws.
8.Seller warrants that the Goods and their markings, labels, design and appearance do not infringe any patents, trade dress, trademarks, trade names, copyrights 
or other rights of others, nor unfairly compete therewith, and that the resale thereof by Buyer, to any person, in any place, with or without any such markings, 
labels, design or appearance, is not restricted in any manner whatsoever. Seller further warrants that all Goods bearing any name or trademark of any third party 
are genuine Goods manufactured in accordance with all applicable quality standards of such third party. Seller agrees that all labels containing Buyer's name or 
trademark will be removed from any Goods not received by Buyer. Seller further agrees that all excess labels over amounts required to fill Buyer's orders will be 
either delivered to Buyer without charge or else destroyed, and in no way will said labels be sold or otherwise used.
9.Nothing herein shall operate to exclude Seller's warranties implied by law. No modification or exclusion of any warranty, express or implied, shall be effective 
unless agreed to by Buyer in a separate written instrument executed by Buyer solely for the purpose of such a modification or exclusion. No Seller's warranty 
shall be excluded because of Buyer's inspection of, or failure or refusal to inspect, the Goods. Seller agrees that any damage or loss resulting from any of the 
Goods not being as warranted by Seller will be deemed as having been proximately caused by Seller's warranty breach regardless of whether, or when, Buyer or 
Buyer's customers took action to inspect the Goods. Buyer retains the right to audit and examine current or past compliance with any warranty by Seller in 
respect of the Goods, and Seller shall cooperate (and ensure cooperation by any manufacturer) as required by Buyer. Seller agrees to immediately notify Buyer 
of any circumstance which does or may result in any of the Goods being in violation of any of Seller's warranties in respect of the Goods. Seller agrees to provide 
Buyer any documents or information requested by Buyer, including without limitation, any documents or information related to production of the Goods. Seller 
represents that the Order qualifies under NAFTA and will provide Buyer all certificates and back-up documentation required in connection with such qualification.
10.In the event of any violation of any warranty or other obligation of Seller under this Order or otherwise with respect to any of the Goods, Buyer shall have the 
right to return any or all of the Goods to Seller for full credit and/or to be compensated for any and all loss or damages suffered by Buyer as a result of such 
violation, and/or such return, including but not limited to Buyer's storage costs, freight costs and handling costs in respect of the Goods. Buyer's incidental and 
consequential damages by reason of such violation and/or any such return (it being understood that Buyer's consequential damages shall include without 
limitation Buyer's lost profits on resale of the Goods and shall be calculated without regard to whether Buyer could have covered or did cover by acquiring 
substitute Goods), and all other costs and expenses associated with such violation or any such return. Seller agrees, at Buyer's request, to assume the defense 
of any suit or claim brought or made against Buyer or any of its affiliates by any third party arising out of or resulting directly or indirectly from any circumstance 
constituting (or which if proven would constitute) a failure or alleged failure of Seller or the Goods to conform to the terms of any obligation of Seller or any 
warranty made by Seller hereunder, and Seller shall be obliged to indemnify Buyer against all loss and expense, including counsel fees and costs of defending, 
incurred by Buyer as a result of any such third-party suit or claim that Buyer may request Seller to assume the defense of (it being understood that Buyer shall 
have the right to approve any settlement of such suit or claim). In the alternative, at Buyer's option, and in Buyer's sole discretion, Buyer may retain full control 
over the defense and settlement of any such third-party suit or claim and may require Seller to cooperate in such defense and settlement, all at Seller's expense, 
including counsel fees, and in such event Seller shall indemnify Buyer against all loss and expense, including counsel fees and the costs of defending, resulting 
from such third-party suit or claim. Seller's indemnity hereunder shall be in favour of Buyer, any company or organization (including any partnership and limited 
liability organization) controlling, controlled by or under common control with Buyer (such companies or organizations sometimes referred to herein as 
"affiliates"), and each of the agents of Buyer and its affiliates. Any action by Seller for breach of this Order must be commenced, and Buyer must be served with 
process in any such action, within a year of the date of breach. All suits or proceedings by Seller against Buyer or any of its affiliates or any of the agents of 
Buyer and its affiliates based upon or arising out of or relating to this Order or the Goods shall be brought or maintained only in courts of proper jurisdiction 
located in the Province of Ontario. Seller agrees to maintain sufficient insurance for general liability coverage with an endorsement for products liability either 
naming Buyer as additional insured, or broad form vendors coverage wherein Buyer becomes a certificate holder with respect to any Goods purchased 
hereunder, and such a certificate shall be provided, at Buyer's request. Failure of Buyer to request or of Seller to provide a certificate of insurance shall not be 
construed to result in a waiver of any of Buyer's rights or Seller's obligations hereunder. Seller agrees to indemnify and hold Buyer and its affiliates and the 
agents of Buyer and its affiliates harmless from and against all claims or suits from third parties, including, without limitation, Buyer's customers, and all loss and 
expense resulting therefrom, based upon or arising from or related to injuries to persons or damage to property caused, or alleged to be caused, by any defect in 
the Goods.
11.If any rights of Seller hereunder shall be assigned then, even after notice to Buyer of such assignment, the assignee shall be bound by, and subject to, any 
defenses which Buyer may have against Seller and any agreements made by Buyer and Seller regarding the Goods or payment therefor, whether such defenses 
and agreements come into existence before or after such assignment (including, without limitation, any claims for defects or returns, any allowances or credits, 
and any offsets that Buyer may have against the original Seller). Notwithstanding any such assignment, Seller shall remain bound by all of Seller's and Seller's 
assignee's obligation hereunder and shall retain full liability to Buyer for any breach of such obligations, whether such breach is committed by Seller itself or by 
Seller's assignee.
12.In the event Seller breaches any of the provisions of this Order, or in the event of any proceedings, voluntary or involuntary, in bankruptcy or insolvency by or 
against Seller, including, without limitation, any proceeding for reorganization, arrangement or settlement, or in the event of the appointment of an assignee for 
the benefit of creditors or of a receiver, Buyer shall be entitled to cancel any unfilled part of this Order without any liability whatsoever and Buyer shall be entitled 
to withhold from any payments due from Buyer an amount estimated by Buyer to be a reasonable reserve for payment to Buyer of any future claims against 
Seller for returns, defects and the like.
13.In addition to and without limitation upon any and all remedies Buyer may have hereunder or otherwise, Buyer shall have the right (a) to recoup any amount due 
to Buyer or any of its, affiliates from Seller from any amount due to Seller from Buyer or any of its affiliates, (b) to set off any amount due to Seller from Buyer or 
any of its affiliates against any amount due to Buyer from Seller (including any amount due for breach of contract or warranty) under this Order, under any other 
contract between the two parties, under any contract between Seller and any affiliate of Buyer or by reason of any other legal obligation that Seller may have to 
Buyer or any of its affiliates, and (c) to set off any amount due to Seller from Buyer or any of affiliates under any other contract between the parties, or by reason 
of any other legal obligation that Buyer or any of its affiliates may have to Seller, against any amount due to Buyer or any of its affiliates from Seller (including 
any amount due to breach of contract or warranty) under this Order.
14.Buyer reserves the right in case of fire, vandalism, malicious mischief, other casualty, war, civil commotion, embargo, governmental regulation or labour dispute, 
or any event beyond its reasonable control to cancel this Order in whole or in part.
15.Title to the Goods and risk of loss or damage shall pass to Buyer at the F.O.B. point on the face of the Order form.

17.This Order, and any claim arising under, based upon, or relating to this Order or the transaction contemplated by this Order, shall be governed by and construed 
and enforced in accordance with the laws of the Province of Ontario, but without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would cause 
application of the law of any other jurisdiction. All rights and remedies of Buyer provided for herein shall be cumulative to one another and cumulative to any 
rights and remedies to which Buyer is entitled by law. Nothing herein shall exclude or limit any other rights and remedies to which Buyer is entitled by law. The 
invalidity of any provision hereof shall not affect the validity of any other provision, and the failure to enforce any provision herein as to any of the Goods shall not 
be deemed a waiver of such enforcement as to such Goods or as to any of the other Goods.
18.The parties have required that this document and all instruments relating thereto be drawn in the English language; Les parties aux présentes ont exigé que ce 
document et tout autre document, qui y sont afférents soient rédigés en langue anglaise.

rejected, Seller's proposed shipment dates shall become a part of this Order; this Order shall be deemed amended so as to apply only to that portion of the 
Goods covered by those of Seller's proposed shipment dates that are not rejected by Buyer; and as so amended this Order shall become a binding agreement 
between Seller and Buyer. Except to the limited extent provided for in the preceding sentence, the terms stated in this Order are the only agreement between 
Seller and Buyer relating to the Goods; shall not be varied by any additional or inconsistent terms contained in any invoice, confirmation or other material of 
Seller; and may only be waived or changed by a written agreement signed by an officer of Buyer.
NOTWITHSTANDING ANY LIMITATION TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED IN ANY PRIOR OR SUBSEQUENT OFFER MADE BY SELLER WITH 
RESPECT TO ANY OF THE GOODS, ANY ACCEPTANCE OF ANY SUCH OFFER CREATED BY THIS ORDER OR BY ANY PRIOR OR SUBSEQUENT 
CONDUCT OF BUYER (INCLUDING BUYER'S ACCEPTANCE OF OR PAYMENT FOR ANY OF THE GOODS) IS EXPRESSLY MADE CONDITIONAL ON 
SELLER'S ASSENT TO ANY AND ALL TERMS SET FORTH IN THIS ORDER THAT MAY BE DIFFERENT FROM OR ADDITIONAL TO THE TERMS OF 
SUCH OFFER.

from at any time exercising any remedies Buyer may have as the result of failure of Seller, or the Goods, to comply with the terms of this Order. Buyer shall have 
no obligation to make payment hereunder prior to acceptance of all Goods ordered hereunder.
4.Receipt by Buyer of any Goods, irrespective of any contrary provisions contained in any document delivered or in any statement made by Seller to Buyer upon 
such receipt, shall not be deemed acceptance. Such receipt shall evidence only the time and place thereof and the quantity of cartons and other shipping 
containers received.
5.At Buyer's option, upon oral or written notice given at any time after discovery thereof, if any part or item of the Goods is not in every respect as required by this 
Order or as warranted herein, or not shipped in compliance with Buyer's shipping directions, the Goods may in whole or in part be rejected and thereupon either 
returned to Seller, at Seller's risk and expense, or held by Buyer for Seller's account, at Seller's risk and expense, or sold by Buyer for Seller's account, at 
Seller's risk and expense or disposed of by Buyer, in each case whether or not any other part or item of the Goods has been previously or may be thereafter 
received or accepted by Buyer. In the event of any such rejection, Buyer shall receive a credit for the amount rejected. In the event Buyer is entitled to reject the 
Goods in whole or in part under the preceding sentence or otherwise, but Buyer nonetheless elects to accept some or all of the Goods, Buyer may retain any 
accepted Goods for its own account and receive a credit from Seller for any of the Goods that Buyer may have elected to reject and for the amount of any 
damages owing to Buyer from Seller in respect of the accepted Goods or any of the Goods that Buyer may have rejected. Until reasonable instructions are 
received from Seller after notice of rejection has been given by Buyer, Buyer is under no duty as to Goods which are perishable or threaten to decline in value 
speedily.
6.Seller warrants that Goods will conform to sample, order specification or standard as to quality, material(s), workmanship, fit and appearance and will be properly 
marked and labeled (including use of the metric system) as to weight, measure, material(s) and ingredients. Seller warrants that the Goods are new, 
merchantable and safe, free from defects in materials or workmanship, and that the handling, wearing or use (including, as applicable, ingestion) of the same will 
not cause harm to any person or damage to the property of any person. Seller agrees that if the Goods are made of materials which require special laundering, 
cleaning, care or handling, they will be plainly marked in a conspicuous place with complete and proper instructions.
7.Seller warrants that it is in compliance with, and that the Goods and their manufacture and shipment to Buyer, will comply with, all international (including country 
of origin), and federal, provincial, and local laws, ordinances, rules and regulations and all applicable industry standards (referred to collectively as "laws") 
applicable to the Goods, or applicable to the advertising, design, distribution, labeling, marking, processing, pricing, production, promotion, sale or testing of the 
Goods, including, but expressly not limited to, laws in the following areas: bribery, consumer product safety, customs, environmental, employment, fair labour, 
forced labour, food and drug, foreign corrupt practices, occupational health and safety, product labeling, sexual harassment and transshipment. In addition, and 
without limiting the foregoing, Seller warrants and Seller agrees to provide Buyer with a signed guarantee in the form, if any, prescribed by such laws before 
payment is required to be made, that the weights, measures, sizes, legends and descriptions, if any, stamped, printed or otherwise attached to the Goods or 
containers or referring to the Goods are correct and comply with such laws.
8.Seller warrants that the Goods and their markings, labels, design and appearance do not infringe any patents, trade dress, trademarks, trade names, copyrights 
or other rights of others, nor unfairly compete therewith, and that the resale thereof by Buyer, to any person, in any place, with or without any such markings, 
labels, design or appearance, is not restricted in any manner whatsoever. Seller further warrants that all Goods bearing any name or trademark of any third party 
are genuine Goods manufactured in accordance with all applicable quality standards of such third party. Seller agrees that all labels containing Buyer's name or 
trademark will be removed from any Goods not received by Buyer. Seller further agrees that all excess labels over amounts required to fill Buyer's orders will be 
either delivered to Buyer without charge or else destroyed, and in no way will said labels be sold or otherwise used.
9.Nothing herein shall operate to exclude Seller's warranties implied by law. No modification or exclusion of any warranty, express or implied, shall be effective 
unless agreed to by Buyer in a separate written instrument executed by Buyer solely for the purpose of such a modification or exclusion. No Seller's warranty 
shall be excluded because of Buyer's inspection of, or failure or refusal to inspect, the Goods. Seller agrees that any damage or loss resulting from any of the 
Goods not being as warranted by Seller will be deemed as having been proximately caused by Seller's warranty breach regardless of whether, or when, Buyer or 
Buyer's customers took action to inspect the Goods. Buyer retains the right to audit and examine current or past compliance with any warranty by Seller in 
respect of the Goods, and Seller shall cooperate (and ensure cooperation by any manufacturer) as required by Buyer. Seller agrees to immediately notify Buyer 
of any circumstance which does or may result in any of the Goods being in violation of any of Seller's warranties in respect of the Goods. Seller agrees to provide 
Buyer any documents or information requested by Buyer, including without limitation, any documents or information related to production of the Goods. Seller 
represents that the Order qualifies under NAFTA and will provide Buyer all certificates and back-up documentation required in connection with such qualification.
10.In the event of any violation of any warranty or other obligation of Seller under this Order or otherwise with respect to any of the Goods, Buyer shall have the 
right to return any or all of the Goods to Seller for full credit and/or to be compensated for any and all loss or damages suffered by Buyer as a result of such 
violation, and/or such return, including but not limited to Buyer's storage costs, freight costs and handling costs in respect of the Goods. Buyer's incidental and 
consequential damages by reason of such violation and/or any such return (it being understood that Buyer's consequential damages shall include without 
limitation Buyer's lost profits on resale of the Goods and shall be calculated without regard to whether Buyer could have covered or did cover by acquiring 
substitute Goods), and all other costs and expenses associated with such violation or any such return. Seller agrees, at Buyer's request, to assume the defense 
of any suit or claim brought or made against Buyer or any of its affiliates by any third party arising out of or resulting directly or indirectly from any circumstance 
constituting (or which if proven would constitute) a failure or alleged failure of Seller or the Goods to conform to the terms of any obligation of Seller or any 
warranty made by Seller hereunder, and Seller shall be obliged to indemnify Buyer against all loss and expense, including counsel fees and costs of defending, 
incurred by Buyer as a result of any such third-party suit or claim that Buyer may request Seller to assume the defense of (it being understood that Buyer shall 
have the right to approve any settlement of such suit or claim). In the alternative, at Buyer's option, and in Buyer's sole discretion, Buyer may retain full control 
over the defense and settlement of any such third-party suit or claim and may require Seller to cooperate in such defense and settlement, all at Seller's expense, 
including counsel fees, and in such event Seller shall indemnify Buyer against all loss and expense, including counsel fees and the costs of defending, resulting 
from such third-party suit or claim. Seller's indemnity hereunder shall be in favour of Buyer, any company or organization (including any partnership and limited 
liability organization) controlling, controlled by or under common control with Buyer (such companies or organizations sometimes referred to herein as 
"affiliates"), and each of the agents of Buyer and its affiliates. Any action by Seller for breach of this Order must be commenced, and Buyer must be served with 
process in any such action, within a year of the date of breach. All suits or proceedings by Seller against Buyer or any of its affiliates or any of the agents of 
Buyer and its affiliates based upon or arising out of or relating to this Order or the Goods shall be brought or maintained only in courts of proper jurisdiction 
located in the Province of Ontario. Seller agrees to maintain sufficient insurance for general liability coverage with an endorsement for products liability either 
naming Buyer as additional insured, or broad form vendors coverage wherein Buyer becomes a certificate holder with respect to any Goods purchased 
hereunder, and such a certificate shall be provided, at Buyer's request. Failure of Buyer to request or of Seller to provide a certificate of insurance shall not be 
construed to result in a waiver of any of Buyer's rights or Seller's obligations hereunder. Seller agrees to indemnify and hold Buyer and its affiliates and the 
agents of Buyer and its affiliates harmless from and against all claims or suits from third parties, including, without limitation, Buyer's customers, and all loss and 
expense resulting therefrom, based upon or arising from or related to injuries to persons or damage to property caused, or alleged to be caused, by any defect in 
the Goods.
11.If any rights of Seller hereunder shall be assigned then, even after notice to Buyer of such assignment, the assignee shall be bound by, and subject to, any 
defenses which Buyer may have against Seller and any agreements made by Buyer and Seller regarding the Goods or payment therefor, whether such defenses 
and agreements come into existence before or after such assignment (including, without limitation, any claims for defects or returns, any allowances or credits, 
and any offsets that Buyer may have against the original Seller). Notwithstanding any such assignment, Seller shall remain bound by all of Seller's and Seller's 
assignee's obligation hereunder and shall retain full liability to Buyer for any breach of such obligations, whether such breach is committed by Seller itself or by 
Seller's assignee.
12.In the event Seller breaches any of the provisions of this Order, or in the event of any proceedings, voluntary or involuntary, in bankruptcy or insolvency by or 
against Seller, including, without limitation, any proceeding for reorganization, arrangement or settlement, or in the event of the appointment of an assignee for 
the benefit of creditors or of a receiver, Buyer shall be entitled to cancel any unfilled part of this Order without any liability whatsoever and Buyer shall be entitled 
to withhold from any payments due from Buyer an amount estimated by Buyer to be a reasonable reserve for payment to Buyer of any future claims against

to Buyer or any of its, affiliates from Seller from any amount due to Seller from Buyer or any of its affiliates, (b) to set off any amount due to Seller from Buyer or 
any of its affiliates against any amount due to Buyer from Seller (including any amount due for breach of contract or warranty) under this Order, under any other 
contract between the two parties, under any contract between Seller and any affiliate of Buyer or by reason of any other legal obligation that Seller may have to 
Buyer or any of its affiliates, and (c) to set off any amount due to Seller from Buyer or any of affiliates under any other contract between the parties, or by reason 
of any other legal obligation that Buyer or any of its affiliates may have to Seller, against any amount due to Buyer or any of its affiliates from Seller (including 
any amount due to breach of contract or warranty) under this Order.
14.Buyer reserves the right in case of fire, vandalism, malicious mischief, other casualty, war, civil commotion, embargo, governmental regulation or labour dispute,

and enforced in accordance with the laws of the Province of Ontario, but without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would cause 
application of the law of any other jurisdiction. All rights and remedies of Buyer provided for herein shall be cumulative to one another and cumulative to any 
rights and remedies to which Buyer is entitled by law. Nothing herein shall exclude or limit any other rights and remedies to which Buyer is entitled by law. The 
invalidity of any provision hereof shall not affect the validity of any other provision, and the failure to enforce any provision herein as to any of the Goods shall not 
be deemed a waiver of such enforcement as to such Goods or as to any of the other Goods.
18.The parties have required that this document and all instruments relating thereto be drawn in the English language; Les parties aux présentes ont exigé que ce

have the right to approve any settlement of such suit or claim). In the alternative, at Buyer's option, and in Buyer's sole discretion, Buyer may retain full control 
over the defense and settlement of any such third-party suit or claim and may require Seller to cooperate in such defense and settlement, all at Seller's expense, 
including counsel fees, and in such event Seller shall indemnify Buyer against all loss and expense, including counsel fees and the costs of defending, resulting 
from such third-party suit or claim. Seller's indemnity hereunder shall be in favour of Buyer, any company or organization (including any partnership and limited

naming Buyer as additional insured, or broad form vendors coverage wherein Buyer becomes a certificate holder with respect to any Goods purchased 
hereunder, and such a certificate shall be provided, at Buyer's request. Failure of Buyer to request or of Seller to provide a certificate of insurance shall not be 
construed to result in a waiver of any of Buyer's rights or Seller's obligations hereunder. Seller agrees to indemnify and hold Buyer and its affiliates and the 
agents of Buyer and its affiliates harmless from and against all claims or suits from third parties, including, without limitation, Buyer's customers, and all loss and

defenses which Buyer may have against Seller and any agreements made by Buyer and Seller regarding the Goods or payment therefor, whether such defenses 
and agreements come into existence before or after such assignment (including, without limitation, any claims for defects or returns, any allowances or credits, 
and any offsets that Buyer may have against the original Seller). Notwithstanding any such assignment, Seller shall remain bound by all of Seller's and Seller's 
assignee's obligation hereunder and shall retain full liability to Buyer for any breach of such obligations, whether such breach is committed by Seller itself or by 
Seller's assignee.

the benefit of creditors or of a receiver, Buyer shall be entitled to cancel any unfilled part of this Order without any liability whatsoever and Buyer shall be entitled

any of its affiliates against any amount due to Buyer from Seller (including any amount due for breach of contract or warranty) under this Order, under any other 
contract between the two parties, under any contract between Seller and any affiliate of Buyer or by reason of any other legal obligation that Seller may have to 
Buyer or any of its affiliates, and (c) to set off any amount due to Seller from Buyer or any of affiliates under any other contract between the parties, or by reason
